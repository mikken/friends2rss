=== friends2rss python script ===

1. Introduction.

Since LiveJournal does not allow to fetch RSS friends feeds for
basic accounts, we introduce this Python 3 script for generating
it locally.

2. How to use.

- Generate cookies file by executing lj_login.py.
It will ask for your username and password and store cookies in
lj_cookies.txt.

- Set friends page URL and parse depth (in pages) in configuration
file (python2rss.conf). Use python2rss.conf.example as a reference.

- 'protected_prefix' option is used for prefixing protected post's
subject.

- Executing friends2rss.py will generate the actual feed.
It'll be stored in friends.xml.

- You should generate the feed periodically using your favourite
tool and add it into agregator software or online services.

- Use -q argument for 'quiet' mode.

3. Requirements.

You need to have lxml installed.

4. Restrictions.

This software will work with new LiveJournal friend feed style.
It's not designed to work with old style.
