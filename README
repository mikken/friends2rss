=== friends2rss python script ===

1. Introduction.

Since LiveJournal does not allow to fetch RSS friends feeds for
basic accounts, we introduce this Python 3 script for generating
it locally.

2. How to use.

- Generate cookies file by executing lj_login.py.
It will ask for your username and password and store cookies in
lj_cookies.txt.

- Set friends page URL and parse depth (in pages) in configuration
file (python2rss.conf). Use python2rss.conf.example as a reference.

- 'protected_prefix' option is used for prefixing protected post's
subject.

- Executing friends2rss.py will generate the actual feed.
It'll be stored in friends.xml.

- You should generate the feed periodically using your favourite
tool and add it into agregator software or online services (like
Google Reader).

- Use -q argument for 'quiet' mode.

3. Requirements.

You need to have Beautiful Soup 4 installed.

4. Restrictions.

This software was tested only on 'Icy Blue' journal style.
May fail with other styles.

5. Known bugs

Reposts' bodies may differ between multiple fetches.
